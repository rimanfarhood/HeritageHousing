## Dataset Content
* The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/housing-prices-data). We then created a fictitious user story where predictive analytics can be applied in a real project in the workplace. 
* The dataset has almost 1.5 thousand rows and represents housing records from Ames, Iowa, indicating house profile (Floor Area, Basement, Garage, Kitchen, Lot, Porch, Wood Deck, Year Built) and its respective sale price for houses built between 1872 and 2010.

## Business Requirements
As a good friend, you are requested by your friend, who has received an inheritance from a deceased great-grandfather located in Ames, Iowa, to  help in maximising the sales price for the inherited properties.

Although your friend has an excellent understanding of property prices in her own state and residential area, she fears that basing her estimates for property worth on her current knowledge might lead to inaccurate appraisals. What makes a house desirable and valuable where she comes from might not be the same in Ames, Iowa. She found a public dataset with house prices for Ames, Iowa, and will provide you with that.

* 1 - The client is interested in discovering how the house attributes correlate with the sale price. Therefore, the client expects data visualisations of the correlated variables against the sale price to show that.
* 2 - The client is interested in predicting the house sale price from her four inherited houses and any other house in Ames, Iowa.
